Presenting D.W.A.I.N., a novel digital drum synthesiser and sequencer using machine learning. Running on the Bela audio processing platform, neural networks are used to create arbitrary mappings between knobs, akin to those on a conventional hardware synthesiser, and various synthesis parameters. D.W.A.I.N. explores the collaboration between musician and instrument, and how the physical interaction between the two can influence the user experience.
