Digital synthesisers are powerful and versatile  but can be limiting in terms of their potential or require too much prior knowledge to program so i am going to build a portable drum synthesiser which will use machine learning to allow a one-to-many mapping between controls and parameters to allow users to create a large variety of complex sounds with fewer controls than a traditional synthesiser


Digital sound synthesis is a powerful and versatile field, but current solutions are either limiting this potential in order to reduce barrier to entry, or provide a means of reaching this potential whilst being too overwhelming for those without prior knowledge. I am building a digital drum synthesiser that will use machine learning to allow a one-to-many mapping between controls and parameters to allow users to explore a large ‘sound space’ with a minimal user interface.
